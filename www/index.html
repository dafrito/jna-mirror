<h2>Java Native Access (JNA) </h2>
<p>A small set of Java language utilities and conventions for dynamically accessing native libraries (for example, <code>.dll</code>'s on Windows or <code>.so</code>'s on Solaris) on any supported platform without writing anything but Java code&#8212;no JNI or native code is required, and access is dynamic at runtime without code generation. </p>
<p>The JNA library uses a small native library stub to dynamically invoke native code without the developer having to write JNI code. The developer describes functions and structures from the target native library in a Java interface. From his perspective, he interacts only with Java code. This makes it quite easy to take advantage of native platform features without getting into the major hassle of writing your own JNI code. It also facilitates implementing cross-platofrm features withing incurring the high overhead of configuring and building JNI for multiple platforms.</p>
<p>JNA's design aims to provide native access in a natural way with a minimum of effort.  No boilerplate or generated code is required.  While some attention is paid to performance, correctness and ease of use take priority.</p>
The <a href="javadoc/overview-summary.html">JavaDoc is available online</a>,

 <h3>Development Tasks</h3>
 <p>The library works fairly well now, but there are a number of tasks with which we'd appreciate help:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>More comprehensive documentation on using JNA, including examples of Java to native conversions of data types, function usage, and proper memory management.</li>
   <li>Native library definitions for the more useful libraries on various platforms; for example, <code>user32</code> on Windows.  This is important not for having an exhaustive library definition but to illustrate all the different ways a native library may need to be mapped.</li>
   <li>Peer review the design and suggest improvements and enhancements</li>
   <li>Port the <code>jnidispatch</code> library to Solaris and any other desired platform (the v3 branch is using libffi from gcc, so it may work out of the box if we can just get access to the appropriate build platform).</li>
   <li>Testing on various JDK versions and platforms (linux flavors!).</li>
   <li>Documentation on multithreaded usage of JNA: Likely danger areas, failure modes, best practices.</li>
   <li>Tests of JNA overhead compared to straight JNI calls (Todd Fast did some of this a long time ago and the results were quite favorable, but it would be nice to have some more recent quantitative data).</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>How To Get Started Using JNA</h3>
 <p>Java Native Access (JNA) has a single component, <code>jna.jar</code>; the supporting native library (<code>jnidispatch</code>) is included in the jar file to avoid extra configuration steps. JNA is capable of extracting and loading the library on its own, so you don't need to reconfigure your native library path in any way.  The native library is also available in a platform-specific jar file for use with Java Web Start.</p>
<p>A simple introduction to using JNA: </p>
<ol>
  <li>From the <a href="https://jna.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=7408&expandFolder=7408&folderID=0">download page</a>, download <code>jna.jar</code>.</li>
  <li>Identify a native <em>target library</em> that you want to invoke from your Java code. This can be any library with exported functions, and it must be loadable from the JDK just like any native library.  A good example is the local C library (libc.so on linux or msvcrt.dll on windows).</li>
  <li>Note that your target library must be available to your Java program. There are several ways to do this:
    <ul>
      <li>The path to the target library (not the jnidispatch library) may be specified by defining the <code>jna.library.path</code> system property, which behaves similarly to <code>java.library.path</code> but only applies to libraries loaded by JNA.  This is the preferred method.</li>
      <li>Add the path to the library to Java's <code>java.library.path</code> system property from the command line. For example, <code>java -Djava.library.path=path/to/jnidispatch/lib ...</code>.</li>
      <li>Change the appropriate library access environment variable.  This is PATH on Windows, LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux, and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on OSX.</li>
      <li>Add the libraries as extensions to your JDK installation. See the JDK documentation for details on this.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Declare a Java interface to hold the native library methods by extending the <a href="javadoc/com/sun/jna/Library.html"><code>Library</code></a> interface.  Declare methods that mirror the functions in the target library by defining Java methods with the same name and argument types as the native function. Following is an example of mapping for the Windows kernel32 library.</li>
  <li>You may also need to declare native structures to pass to your native functions. To do this, create a class that extends <a href="javadoc/com/sun/jna/Structure.html"><code>Structure</code></a> and add public fields (which may include arrays or nested structures). You can add normal Java methods also, but they will not be used by JNA.</li>
  <li>In your interface, allocate an instance of the native library using the <code>Native.loadLibrary(Class)</code> method, providing the native library interface you defined in step (4).<br>    
    <textarea name="textarea" cols="80" rows="24" readonly="readonly">
package com.sun.jna.examples.win32;

import com.sun.jna.*;

// kernel32.dll uses the __stdcall calling convention
// Most C libraries will just extend com.sun.jna.Library
public interface Kernel32 extends StdCallLibrary { 

    Kernel32 INSTANCE = (Kernel32)
        Native.loadLibrary("kernel32", Kernel32.class);

    public static class SYSTEMTIME extends Structure {
        public short wYear;
        public short wMonth;
        public short wDayOfWeek;
        public short wDay;
        public short wHour;
        public short wMinute;
        public short wSecond;
        public short wMilliseconds;
    }

    void GetSystemTime(SYSTEMTIME result);
}</textarea>
  </li>
  <li>Simply invoke methods on the returned Java instance just like any other Java class. The JNA library marshals values to and from native code and invokes native functions using the <code>jnidispatch</code> library. For a more extensive example, see the <a href="https://jna.dev.java.net/source/browse/jna/trunk/jnalib/src/com/sun/jna/examples/WindowUtils.java?rev=HEAD&view=markup">WindowUtils</a> and <a href="https://jna.dev.java.net/source/browse/jna/trunk/jnalib/src/com/sun/jna/examples/ShapedWindowDemo.java?rev=HEAD&view=markup">ShapedWindowDemo</a> classes.
    <br>    
    <textarea name="textarea4" cols="80" rows="6" readonly="readonly">
Kernel32 lib = Kernel32.INSTANCE;
SYSTEMTIME time = new SYSTEMTIME();
lib.GetSystemTime(time);
System.out.println("Today's integer value is " + time.wDay);
</textarea>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>By-reference Arguments</h3>
When a function accepts a pointer-to-type argument you can use one of the <a href="javadoc/com/sun/jna/ptr/ByReference.html"><code>ByReference</code></a> types to capture the returned value.  For example:<br>
<blockquote>
    <textarea name="textarea4" cols="80" rows="13" readonly="readonly">
// C code
void allocate_buffer(char **bufp, int* lenp);

// Java interface
void allocate_buffer(PointerByReference bufp, IntByReference lenp);

// Usage
PointerByReference pref = new PointerByReference();
IntByReference iref = new IntByReference();
lib.allocate_buffer(pref, iref);
Pointer p = pref.getValue();
byte[] buffer = p.getByteArray(0, iref.getValue());
    </textarea>
</blockquote>

The <a href="javadoc/com/sun/jna/Pointer.html"><code>Pointer</code></a> class provides a number of accessor methods similar to <a href="javadoc/com/sun/jna/Pointer.html#getByteArray"><code>getByteArray</code></a> which effectively function as a typecast onto the memory.

<h3>Callbacks</h3>
Callback declarations consist of a simple interface that extends the Callback
interface and implements a <code>callback</code> method.  Callbacks are
implemented by wrapping a Java object method in a little bit of C glue code.
The simplest usage resembles using anonymous inner classes to register event
listeners.  Following is an example of callback usage:<br> 
<blockquote>
    <textarea name="textarea4" cols="80" rows="18" readonly="readonly">
public interface User32 extends StdCallLibrary {
    interface WNDENUMPROC extends StdCallCallback {
        /** Return whether to continue enumeration. */
        boolean callback(Pointer hWnd, Pointer arg);
    }
    boolean EnumWindows(WNDENUMPROC lpEnumFunc, Pointer arg);
}
...
User32 user32 = User32.INSTANCE;

user32.EnumWindows(new WNDENUMPROC() {
    int count;
    public boolean callback(Pointer hWnd, Pointer userData) {
        System.out.println("Found window " + hWnd + ", total " + ++count);
        return true;
    }
}, null);
</textarea>
</blockquote>
See the <a href="javadoc/overview-summary.html">JavaDoc overview</a> for additional details.<p>

<h3>Invocation from Dynamically-Typed Languages</h3>
Languages such as <a href=http://www.jython.org>Jython</a> or <a href=http://jruby.sf.net>JRuby</a> may find it more convenient to access the NativeLibrary and Function classes directly rather than establishing a dedicated interface.<p>
Here's a brief example of using JNA from JRuby:
<blockquote>
    <textarea name="textarea4" cols="80" rows="16" readonly="readonly">
require 'java'

module Libc
  @@lib = com.sun.jna.NativeLibrary.getInstance("c")
  @@ptr_funcs = [ 'fopen', 'malloc', 'calloc' ]
  def self.method_missing(meth, *args)
    if @@ptr_funcs.include?(meth.to_s)
      @@lib.getFunction(meth.to_s).invokePointer(args.to_java)
    else
      @@lib.getFunction(meth.to_s).invokeInt(args.to_java)
    end
  end
  O_RDONLY = 0
  O_WRONLY = 1
  O_RDWR = 2
end

Libc.puts("puts from libc")
Libc.printf("Hello %s, from printf\n", "World")

file = Libc.open("/dev/stdout", 1, Libc::O_WRONLY)
n = Libc.write(file, "Test\n", 5)
puts "Wrote #{n} bytes via Libc"

path = "/dev/stdout"
fp = Libc.fopen(path, "w+")
Libc.fprintf(fp, "fprintf to %s via stdio\n", path)
Libc.fflush(fp)
Libc.fclose(fp)
</textarea></blockquote>

<h3>Building and Multi-platform support</h3>
JNA has been built and tested on OSX (GCC, PPC and x86), linux (GCC, x86), and
Windows (MSVC and GCC, x86).  There's some old dispatch code for sparc, but I
don't have a machine to run or test it on.  The ant build script's test target
will build and run the test suite, which has decent coverage and is a quick
way to determine if your environment is set up correctly.<p>
If you want to do a build yourself, you'll need <a href="http://ant.apache.org">ANT</a>, <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/make.html">GNU make</a> and a compiler.  On windows, you can use either <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">gcc (cygwin)</a> or MSVC.  To rebuild <code>jna.jar</code>, and run the unit tests, do<br>
<blockquote><code><pre>
% ant dist test
</pre></code></blockquote>
<p>
The project also includes <a href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> project configurations, if you're so inclined.<p>

the JNA library (and are pretty nifty utilities in and of themselves).

<h3>History</h3>
<p>This work is based on a small shared stubs library originally written by Sheng Liang of the Sun JNI team and demoed at JavaOne circa 1999. <p>
Todd Fast first published this project on dev.java.net in fall of 2006 (the state of this code is still available in the SVN repo under the <a href="https://jna.dev.java.net/svn/jna/tags/CVS%20HEAD">CVS HEAD</a> tag).  From the original project announcement:
<blockquote><pre>
Headline        Initial JNA code checked in
Date            Nov 30, 2006

</pre>
Announcement<p>

Thanks everyone for your interest in the Java Native Access (JNA) project! I've just checked in the initial code. I've worked on this little project off-and-on for the better part of 6-7 years, and this release comes about a year after I last looked at it. Therefore, I'm only just now getting familiar with it again after refactoring and redesigning for JDK 5 last year, so there may be any number of issues or shortcomings leftover since my last time with it. Please look through the code and get involved!<p>

The Java library code is contained in a NetBeans 5.x project. If you want to build it, please use NetBeans or use the Ant build script in the root of the jnalib/ directory. I will upload a binary at some point to make it a bit easier to get started.<p>

I've checked in binaries of the jnidispatch library and the testlib library for Win32 (.dll's), but don't have convenient access to build these for other platforms. I would greatly appreciate help from others to compile and test versions for other platforms, particularly Mac OS.<p>

To get an idea how to use JNA, please refer to the JUnit tests in the test/ directory. These are crufty and not meant to be examples, but will have to suffice until real samples are available (I would definitely appreciate community help with those as well). Note that you will need to modify your java.library.path system property to include the jnidispatch binary (and possibly the testlib binary) in order to use JNA or run the unit tests. For example:
java -Djava.library.path=./native/testlib/Debug;./native/jnidispatch/Debug ... 
</blockquote>

<p>Timothy Wall picked up the project in February of 2007, introducing a number of critical features and making the whole accessible to a wider community.  I was looking for a way to experiment with native libraries without having to carve out a new Makefile and build process (those of you who've never built multi-lingual projects involving C don't know what you're missing).  Specifically I wanted some shaped windows and a cross-platform native file monitor.  After a few proof-of-concept tests, I scouted around for existing projects from which I could bootstrap (see the <a href="https://jna.dev.java.net/svn/jna/trunk/jnalib/TODO">TODO</a> file for some of the projects that are out there).  JNA had the simplest, most straightforward architecture (as did <a href="http://nlink.dev.java.net">NLINK</a>, which likely had the same roots).  It was also the least problematic to make work cross-platform with a consistent build process.<p>

Many thanks to Sheng Liang and Todd Fast for their contributions to this project.
