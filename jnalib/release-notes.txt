Release 3.0
Features
* More supported platforms, via GCC's libffi (wmeissner)
* Provide access to native peer for java.awt.Component 
* Provide access to native peer on OS X.
* Support MINGW32 builds (fullung)
* Allow per-field Structure read/write by field name
* Avoid writing Structure fields marked 'volatile'
* Read and wrap function pointers in Structure fields when read with a Java
  proxy to allow easy Java-side invocation (Ken Larson)
* Support array-backed Buffers as arguments (wmeissner)
* Auto-conversion of custom types (wmeissner)
* Allow pointer type-safety
* Optional VM crash protection, via Native.setProtected(boolean)

Bug Fixes
* Avoid attempts to free native library if it failed to load (wmeissner)
* Explicitly check method signatures for varargs instead of heuristically
  guessing (wmeissner)
* Disallow declaring Pointer-derived fields in Structures (Function, Memory)
* Ensure Object.toString/hashCode/equals methods are intercepted on proxyied
  interfaces
* Update X11 library for 64-bit use (wmeissner)

Release 2.5
Features
* Unions
* Optimized shaped windows (chris deckers & olivier chafik); instantiation time
improved by about 2-3 orders of magnitude for large, mostly contiguous shapes
* Provide type mapping in callback arguments/results
* Provide access to ByteBuffer direct address as a Pointer
* Provide customization of native string encoding with jna.encoding system property 

Bug Fixes
* Properly handle VMs with reversed Structure member storage
* Avoid making window undecorated when clearing window mask on X11
* Fix structure alignment bug on OSX/PPC when first element is > 4 bytes in size
* Clearing OSX window mask by setting to MASK_NONE now works properly
* Avoid index exceptions if native buffers are not NUL-terminated on string conversions
* Write initialized Structure[] argument memory prior to function calls
* Fix IllegalArgumentException reading WString into a Structure
* Clear memory when allocating a structure block (fixes VM crash)
* Remove versioned JAWT dependency on OSX, allowing use on 10.3/JRE1.4.

Release 2.4
Features
* Explicitly support unaligned structures
* Auto-reallocate structure arrays
* Automatic handling of w32 UNICODE/ASCII variants
* Automatic mapping of decorated w32 stdcall function names
* Customizable, automatic type conversion of arguments and results (wmeissner)
* Support char*[] arguments as Java String[] 
* Structure supports Callback members (wmeissner)
* getByteBuffer from Pointer/Memory (wmeissner)
* Allow GC of native libraries
* Facilitate use from non-Java contexts (JRuby et al.) (wmeissner)
* Improve library path searching (wmeissner)
* Handle Structure[] arguments
* Handle native long arguments and return values
* Handle direct and array-based ByteBuffer arguments (wmeissner)
* Change default w32 build to use GCC (it's free, yo)

Bug Fixes
* Structure.toArray failed to initialize members
* Disallow explicit free of Structure/Memory
* Ensure native libraries are only loaded once until released
* Properly handle NULL when the return value is a Structure
* Proper conversion to wchar_t on linux
* Copy full length of Java strings to C strings instead of stopping when a NUL
character is encountered
